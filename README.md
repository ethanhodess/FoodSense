# FoodSense
## Introduction
Welcome to FoodSense, an iOS app designed as a digital notebook for mindful food logging! As existing food logging apps tend to focus on calorie tracking, food and diet analysis, and food recognition, FoodSense's aim is to provide a way for users to log meals simultaneously with the relevent context about how they are feeling in the moment that may affect food choices. For everyone, emotional eating is a big factor in how well we can stick to a healthy diet, and by logging this information we can hopefully see our own trends and be able to recognize them in the future. 

## How to use
Upon opening the app, you can press "log meal" to enter the logging survey.

After filling out the survey, your log will be stored in a cloud database. At any point these logs can be viewed by pressing "meal history" on the home page. This will present the meal history page where logs can be viewed and filtered for specific results.

FoodSense is aimed to serve as a digital notebook where users can log any information related to their eating that might be helpful to remember later on. By saving these log entries and allowing for filtering in multiple ways, we aim to help users stick to a healthier diet that can improve their general wellness.
